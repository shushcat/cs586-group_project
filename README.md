##### From _Data is plural_

>__Education data, unified.__ “[Every year](https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer/about/), the federal government releases large amounts of data on US schools, districts, and colleges. But this information is scattered across multiple datasets, and changes in data structure make it hard to measure change.” The [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/)’s [Education Data Explorer](https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer/) aims to fix that by pulling together the Department of Education’s [Common Core of Data](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/), [Civil Rights Data Collection](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/), [Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/), and [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/), plus the Census Bureau’s [Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe.html). You download custom queries, [access the data via an API](https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/), or download bulk files for all [elementary and secondary schools](https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/schools.html), [school districts](https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/school-districts.html), and [colleges](https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/colleges.html).

>__Private schools.__ The [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/)’s [Private School Universe Survey](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/index.asp) has been gathering [data about private elementary and secondary schools](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/pssdata.asp) every two years since the 1989–90 school year. It collects information on “religious orientation; level of school; size of school; length of school year, length of school day; total enrollment (K-12); number of high school graduates, whether a school is single-sexed or coeducational and enrollment by sex; number of teachers employed; program emphasis” and more. In the latest data, covering the 2021–22 school year, “there were 29,727 private schools, enrolling 4,731,303 students and employing 482,571 full-time teachers”. __As seen in__: ProPublica’s [Private School Demographics lookup tool](https://projects.propublica.org/private-school-demographics) ([webinar scheduled for January 31](https://www.propublica.org/events/how-to-use-our-private-school-demographics-news-app)) and its [reporting on “segregation academies”](https://www.propublica.org/series/segregation-academies).

>__Educational attainment.__ Researchers at the Vienna-based [Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital](http://www.wittgensteincentre.org/en/index.htm) have developed a dataset of [historical and projected education levels for 171 countries](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-demographic-economics/article/a-harmonized-dataset-on-global-educational-attainment-between-1970-and-2060-an-analytical-window-into-recent-trends-and-future-prospects-in-human-capital-development/D5540E2C23E4CB89AF08ECD9379B38FD). For five-year age groups in each country, the project estimates the percentage of people in each of several categories of educational attainment — no education, primary education, secondary education, post-secondary education, and a few gradations in between. The dataset is available to browse and download via the [Wittgenstein Centre Data Explorer](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/fileadmin/subsites/Institute/VID/dataexplorer/index.html) – look for “Educational Attainment Distribution” in the “indicators” dropdown.

>__Women’s well-being.__ [Camille Belmin et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01824-2)’s [LivWell dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/7277104) presents “a set of key indicators on women’s socio-economic status, health and well-being, access to basic services and demographic outcomes” in 447 regions of 52 countries from 1990 to 2019. The indicators include, for example, rates of home ownership, educational attainment, and domestic violence; they’re based primarily on [data](https://dhsprogram.com/data/) from the [Demographic and Health Surveys Program](https://dhsprogram.com/), a [USAID-funded](https://dhsprogram.com/Who-We-Are/About-Us.cfm) initiative that, since 1984, “has provided technical assistance to more than 400 surveys in over 90 countries, advancing global understanding of health and population trends in developing countries.” __Read more__: [An introductory Twitter thread from Belmin](https://twitter.com/BelminCamille/status/1597948618220384256).

>__Critical infrastructure density.__ [Sadhana Nirandjan et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01218-4) have developed “a first-of-its-kind globally harmonized spatial dataset” representing the density of critical infrastructure, built with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data (and [noting its limitations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01218-4#Sec16)). The researchers selected 39 kinds of structures (railways, landfills, pharmacies, etc.), grouped into seven categories: education, energy, health, telecommunication, transportation, waste, and water. Then they [calculated](https://github.com/snirandjan/CISI) those categories’ [concentrations at 0.10°- and 0.25°-grid resolutions](https://zenodo.org/record/4957647). __Previously__: [US infrastructure, from the Department of Homeland Security](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/) ([DIP 2016.03.02](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2016-03-02-edition/)).

>__Military surplus.__ Through its [Excess Defense Articles program](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS20428.html), the US military offers free and reduced-price equipment to foreign governments. The Department of Defense [publishes a spreadsheet of the program’s authorizations and transfers](https://www.dsca.mil/programs/excess-defense-articles-eda), last updated in mid–2020 and going back to 2010. Each of the 4,100+ entries lists the foreign country, item description, transfer status, status date, whether it was a sale or grant, quantities (requested, allocated, accepted, rejected, delivered), “current” value, and acquisition value. Items range in size and significance, from vinyl tape (55 rolls authorized for transfer to Iraq in 2016) to [Abrams tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams) (including 178 provided to Morocco in 2018).

>__SAT, ACT, and AP scores.__ The California Department of Education publishes [aggregate scores on these high-school tests](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sp/ai/) for each county, district, and school going back to the late 1990s. One hitch: For more than two months, the 2016 AP data “contained 350,000 more tests than had actually been taken,” [according to inewsource.org’s Megan Wood](http://inewsource.org/2017/06/13/state-admits-posting-faulty-data/), who spotted the discrepancies (and others) and got the department to fix them. Similar datasets are available from other states, including [Texas](http://tea.texas.gov/acctres/sat_act_index.html), [Florida](http://www.fldoe.org/accountability/accountability-reporting/act-sat-ap-data/index.stml), and [Pennsylvania](http://www.education.pa.gov/K-12/Assessment%20and%20Accountability/Pages/SAT-and-ACT.aspx#tab-1). __Bonus:__ inewsource.org’s has also published easy-to-search tables of the California [AP](http://data.inewsource.org/interactives/california-ap-scores-2011-2016/), [SAT](http://data.inewsource.org/interactives/california-sat-scores-2011-2016/), and [ACT](http://data.inewsource.org/interactives/california-act-scores-2011-2016/) scores.

The resulting dataset, which spans ~70,000 public schools, can be [downloaded in bulk](https://purl.stanford.edu/zf406jp4427) and [explored online](https://stanford-school-enrollment-project.datasette.io/). Most states provided data down to the grade level; some also provided student counts by gender, race, ethnicity, ELL status, homelessness, economic status, and/or disability. The timeframes vary, but include at least the 2019–20 and 2020–21 school years for each state. See the [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WRm4KZPDGL1USPaf0E1AIa7gbyeKncv04Pg_rM1N7po/edit) for details. __As seen in__: “[The Kindergarten Exodus](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/07/us/covid-kindergarten-enrollment.html)” (NYT), “[How going remote led to dramatic drops in public school students](https://edsource.org/2021/how-going-remote-led-to-dramatic-drops-in-public-school-students/659005)” (EdSource), and a [new academic study](https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/revealed-preferences-school-reopening-evidence-public-school-disenrollment).

>__Foreign gifts to U.S. universities.__ The Department of Education [requires U.S. universities to report](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/school/foreign-gifts) all major gifts from (and contracts with) foreign entities. The agency’s [database of these gifts and contracts](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/foreign-gifts-and-contracts-report-2011) currently covers 2012 to mid-2018, and includes 18,000+ entries from more than 150 schools. __Related:__ In the wake of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, the AP’s Collin Binkley and Chad Day used the data [to examine colleges’ financial ties to Saudi Arabia](https://www.apnews.com/4d56411af6a8490e8030eacab4401571).

>__Home schooling.__ The Washington Post has gathered [data on home-school enrollment figures](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data_home_schooling) in dozens of US states and 6,700+ school districts over the past six academic years. Post reporters, with help from students at American University, “trawled state websites, contacted education officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and submitted multiple public records requests” to build the dataset, [released last week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2023/11/09/tracking-home-schooling-an-expansive-data-set-exclusively-washington-post/). Each entry [indicates](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data_home_schooling/blob/main/home_school_data_dictionary.csv) the state/district, school year, and the number of students registered for home schooling. __Read more__: [The Post’s analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/2023/homeschooling-growth-data-by-district/), which “reveals that a dramatic rise in home schooling at the onset of the pandemic has largely sustained itself through the 2022-23 academic year, defying predictions […].” [h/t [Meghan Hoyer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/meghan-hoyer/)]

>__College sports financing.__ The Huffington Post and Chronicle of Higher Education teamed up to investigate [how colleges bankroll their athletics](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/projects/ncaa/sports-at-any-cost). (Georgia State, for example, [spent more than $100 million subsidizing sports between 2010 and 2014](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/projects/ncaa/subsidy-scorecards/eastern-kentucky-university), mostly via student fees.) The report, published last week, draws on five years of revenue/expense reports from 234 Division I public universities. You can [download the raw data](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/ncaa/reporters-note) or [explore it online](http://projects.huffingtonpost.com/projects/ncaa/subsidy-scorecards). Related: The Washington Post also tackled this topic — from a slightly different angle — last week, [examining the profitability (or lack thereof) of athletic programs at 48 schools](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/sports/wp/2015/11/23/running-up-the-bills/).

>__“There’s finally federal data on low-income college graduation rates—but it’s wrong.”__ The Hechinger Report [casts doubt on the Pell grant graduation numbers](http://hechingerreport.org/theres-finally-federal-data-on-low-income-college-graduation-rates-but-its-wrong/) contained in the Department of Education’s recently-released [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). Why the discrepancy? “[W]hile schools are required by law to provide the graduation rates of Pell recipients to any applicants who ask, a loophole protects them from having to report the same figures to the government.” Oof.

>__Metro-area segregation.__ “[W]hy are so many cities and metropolitan areas still split along racial lines? And what is the role of local government in reinforcing those divides? To answer those questions, *Governing* conducted a [six-month investigation of black-white segregation](https://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-segregation-series.html) in the small cities of downstate Illinois.” As part of the investigation, the magazine calculated (and published) [school](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/school-segregation-dissimilarity-index-for-metro-areas.html) and [residential](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/residential-racial-segregation-metro-areas.html) segregation metrics for hundreds of U.S. metropolitan areas, [based on](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/segregation-report-methodology.html) the latest Department of Education and Census Bureau data. __Related:__ “[The Most Diverse Cities Are Often The Most Segregated](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/)” (FiveThirtyEight, 2015).
